%\section{Summary of results}

A study of \CP violation in the \btodkst mode has been performed, with the \D meson decaying to \Kp\pim, \Kp\pim, \pip\pim, \Kp\pim\pip\pim and \pip\pim\pip\pim final states. The data analysed in this study were collected in proton-proton collisions by the \lhcb detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) between 2011 and 2016. The study used 1\invfb and 2\invfb of data at centre of mass energies of $\sqrt{s} = 7\tev \text{ and } 8\tev$ collected in 2011 and 2012 respectively, and 1.8\invfb at $\sqrt{s} = 13\tev$ collected in 2015 and 2016.

The world's most precise measurement of \CP violation in \btodkst decays has been made, using approximately 3660 signal events across all \Dz decay modes. The major results from this analysis are the \CP observables relating to the yield ratios and asymmetries, which are:

where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. These measurements are found to be consistent with and more precise than the previous measurements from \babar~\cite{BaBarDKstar}. The first evidence of the two-body ADS mode, \pik, was obtained with a statistical significance of 4.2$\sigma$. The sensitivity to the unitary triangle angle \Pgamma was extracted, obtaining a central value of $41^{\circ}$ with a $1\sigma$ confidence interval of $[25, 58]^{\circ}$, and $2\sigma$ confidence intervals of $[10, 87]^{\circ}$ and $[97,167]^{\circ}$. Also, the current best sensitivity to the hadronic parameters of the \Bm decay, namely \rb and \deltab, has been presented.

The work presented in this thesis provides a significant contribution to the measurement of \Pgamma, representing a parameterisation of \CP violation in the Standard Model. Inconsistencies between direct and indirect measurements of \Pgamma could indicate new \CP violation effects beyond the Standard Model and, if found, could give an insight into the flavour structure of New Physics. This would ultimately help generate a deeper understanding of the large matter-antimatter asymmetry observed in the Universe.

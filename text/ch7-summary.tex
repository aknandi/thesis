\section{Summary of results}

A study of \CP violation in the \btodkst mode was performed, with \D meson decays to \Kp\pim, \Kp\pim, \pip\pim, \Kp\pim\pip\pim and \pip\pim\pip\pim final states. The data analysed in this study was collected by the \lhcb detector from proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) between 2011 and 2016. This study used 1\invfb and 2\invfb of $pp$ collisions at centre of mass energy, $\sqrt{s} = 7\tev \text{ and } 8\tev$ collected in 2011 and 2012, and 1.8\invfb at $\sqrt{s} = 13\tev$ collected in 2015 and 2016. An GLW/ADS analysis was carried out to extract the \CP observables by performing a simultaneous fit to the data using a model developed to describe the selected \btodkst decays.

The world's most precise measurements of \CP violation in \btodkst decays were made using approximately 3660 events across all \Dz decay modes. The results are from this analysis are:

The measurements are found to consistent and more precise compared to previous measurements from \babar~\cite{BaBarDKstar}. The first evidence for \CP violation in the two-body ADS mode was obtained with a significance of 4.2$\sigma$. The senstivity to \Pgamma was extracted, as well as obtaining the current best sensitivity to the hadronic parameters of the \Bm decay, namely \rb and \deltab. CL on \Pgamma.

\section{Outlook}

Comparison of direct and indirect. Continue to measure gamma directly, reduce uncertainty. 

Statistically limited. Specific about runs and amount of data to be collected. Increase in yield per fb-1 with com energy. Increase in yield with upgrade. Reduction on gamma sensitivity. Inclusion with other modes

Methods. GLW/ADS. Also use GGSZ. Advantages disadvantages. Remove two fold ambiguity. BESIII

New Physics. Matter antimatter asymmetry. Bigger picture

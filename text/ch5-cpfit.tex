\chapter{\label{ch:5-cpfit}Fits for \CP observables in two- and four-body decays} 

\minitoc

In this section the \CP observables are measured by performing a fit to \btodkst candidates in data simultaneously for each \Dz decay mode for both \Bp and \Bm decays. This fit is referred to in this thesis as the \CP fit. The setup of the \CP fit is outlined in Section \ref{sec:cpfit:setup}, followed by the fit results in Section \ref{sec:cpfit:results}. Section \ref{sec:systematics} outlines the systematic uncertainties and the results of the \CP observables are summarised in Section \ref{sec:cpfit:summary}.

\section{Setup of \CP fit}
\label{sec:cpfit:setup}

The fit to data is performed on the invariant mass of \btodkst candidates. A simultaneous fit stategy is employed to fit each of the \Dz decay modes as well as two bins of \B charge (\Bp and \Bm), two bins of \KS track type (LL and DD) and two bins of data type (\runone and \runtwo), resulting in 56 bins in total. The parameters extracted from the \CP fit are the \CP observables, namely \Akpi, \Akk, \Apipi, \Rkk, \Rpipi, \Rptwo, \Rmtwo, \Akpipipi, \Apipipipi, \Rpipipipi, \Rpfour and \Rmfour, which relate to the physics parameters of interest as shown in Equations \ref{exp_Acp} - \ref{exp_R4pi}.

The \CP fit is perfromed from 5230\mevcc, as justified in Section \ref{sec:cpfit:range}. The components and shapes of the \CP fit are the identical to those described in Section \ref{sec:massfit}, with the execption of and additional component in the \kk mass spectrum, detailed in Section \ref{sec:cpfit:Lb2LcKst}. The mean and width of the signal shape are shared across the different run periods and across modes of the same number of final state particles, but the mean and width are allowed to be different for the two- and four-body modes. The shape and yield of the partially reconstructed background is completely fixed, with different shape parameters for LL and DD candidates. The shape is fixed as described in Section \ref{sec:massfit:partreco}, using the yield ratios given in Table \ref{fixedyieldratios}. The total partially reconstructed yield is fixed from the fits in Figures \ref{massfitskpi} and \ref{massfitsk3pi}, the values for the total partially reconstructed yield in each of the simultaneous fit categories is given in Section \ref{sec:cpfit:partrecoyields}. The shape of the combinatoric background is shared across all modes of the same number of final state particles, but has different values for LL and DD candidates, as well as two and four-body D modes.

\subsection{Additional background component in \kk mass spectrum}
\label{sec:cpfit:Lb2LcKst}

The mass fit model described in Section \ref{sec:massfit} is used to model all \Dz modes in the \CP fit, however, there is an additional source of background included in the \kk model that does not occur in the other modes. This background in the \kk \Bm mass spectrum comes from the decay \decay{\Lb}{\Lc(p\Km\pip)\Kstarm}, where the proton is misidentified as a kaon and the \pion is missed in the reconstruction. The decay mode \decay{\Lc}{p\Km\pip} accounts for over 6\% of the \Lc branching fraction~\cite{PDG2016}, whereas \Lc decays that may contribute as background to the other \Dz decay modes, e.g. \decay{\Lc}{p\pim\pip}, are suppressed by an order of magnitude. Therefore, this background is only considered for the \kk decay model.

The shape used to model this \decay{\Lb}{\Lc(p\Km\pip)\Kstarm} contribution is a Cruijff PDF, defined as,
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{Cruijff}(m; \mu,\sigma_L,\sigma_R,\alpha_L,\alpha_R)=
\begin{cases}
    exp \left( -\frac{(m-\mu)^2}{2\sigma_L^2 + \alpha_L(m-\mu)^2} \right) ,     & \text{if } m-\mu < 0, \\
    exp \left( -\frac{(m-\mu)^2}{2\sigma_R^2 + \alpha_R(m-\mu)^2} \right) ,     & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\label{Cruijff}
\end{equation}%
where $\mu$ is the peak position, $\sigma_{L,R}$ is the width on the left and right sides of the peak and $\alpha_{L,R}$ is a modification constant. The shape parameters can be taken from using a simulated sample of \decay{\Lc}{p\Km\pip} events, reconstructed as \decay{\Bm}{\D\Kstarm} signal events, and performing a fit to the \Bm mass distribution. However, due to reasons relating to timing and speed of generation, a simulated sample of \decay{\Lc}{p\Km\pip} events was not available. Instead, the shape parameters are taken from a fit to a simulated sample of \decay{\Lb}{\Lc\Km} events reconstructed as \decay{\Bm}{\D\Km} events; this shape is expected to be similar to \decay{\Lc}{p\Km\pip}, and any uncertainty in the shape is accounted for as a systematic uncertainty, described in Section \ref{sec:systematics}.

The fit to the \Bm mass spectrum is shown in Figure \ref{Lbfit}, where it can be seen that the reconstructed \Bm mass falls between 4800 and 5500 \mevcc, and the results from this fit are shown in Table \ref{fitresultsLb}. All the values for the shape parameters are fixed in the simultaneous fit to the values in Table \ref{fitresultsLb}; these fixed values are considered to be a source of systematic uncertainty, detailed in Section \ref{sec:systematics}.

\caption{Shape parameters from a fit to simulated \decay{\Lb}{\Lc\Km} events using a Cruijff PDF. These shape parameters are fixed with an associated systematic uncertainty.}
\label{fitresultsLb}
\end{table}

The shape is assumed to be the same in each \kk fit category, across \KS reconstruction types and data-taking periods. The \decay{\Lb}{\Lc(p\kaon\pi)\Kstarm} yield compared to the signal yield in the favoured \kpi mode is allowed to vary in the simultaneous fit. This fractional yield is required to be the same for all fit categories.

\subsection{Choice of fit range}
\label{sec:cpfit:range}	

Fixing the relative yields for the partially reconstructed shapes, as described in Section \ref{sec:massfit:partreco}, assumes that no \CP violation occurs, i.e. the relative yields for \Bm and \Bp are the same. This is a reasonable assumption for the favoured \kpi and \kpipipi decays considered in this section, where we do not expect \CP violation. However in the other \D final states, for example \pik, \CP violation is expected in the partially reconstructed background for which the yield ratios are entirely unknown. Therefore, it is not possible make any constraints on the yield ratios in these modes. The fit that would result from fitting six individual yields with an order of magnitude less data would be unstable and this lack of constraint in the low mass region would lead to a large amount of freedom in the combinatorial, significantly affecting the signal yield. 

The overlap of the partially reconstructed and signal peaks is very small. There are a number of advantages to raising the lower range of the mass parameterisation up to 5230 \mev, which only removes 0.4\% of signal. The advantages include avoiding the need to fit the various partially reconstructed yields in each of the other D decays modes. These cannot use the same assumptions and fractions as determined in the Cabibbo-favoured mode due to expected CP violation. Further benefits are that low level broad backgrounds that may be present in the range 4900 - 5200 \mev do not need to considered as sources of systematics uncertainty. The shape and yield of the small amount of partially reconstructed background present in all \D decay categories above 5230 \mev is determined and fixed from the fits to data of the \kpi and \kpipipi decays, taking into account the smaller branching fractions of the \D decays. It is less than an event for all the CP violating modes. Due to the assumptions present in the initial fit, uncertainties in the yield and shape and possible asymmetries in distribution between \Bp and \Bm are evaluated as systematic uncertainties. This systematic uncertainty is dealt with in Section \ref{sec:systematics:partreco}.

\subsection{Partially reconstructed yield in \CP fit}
\label{sec:cpfit:partrecoyields}

The modelling of the partially reconstructed background is described in detail in Section \ref{sec:massfit:partreco}. As discussed in Section \ref{sec:cpfit:range}, the low mass limit in the \CP fit is 5230\mevcc, which removes almost all of the partially reconstrcuted background. The \CP fit fully fixes the shape and yield of the partially reconstructed background in each of the different \Dz modes. Table \ref{partrecofixedyields} shows the fixed values of the total partially reconstructed yield in the \CP fit.

\label{partrecofixedyields}
\end{table}

\subsection{Corrections to yield ratios}
\label{sec:cpfit:efficiencies}

The \CP fit measures seven observables, \Rkk, \Rpipi, \Rptwo, \Rmtwo, \Rpipipipi, \Rpfour and \Rmfour, which relate to the ratio of the yields in each \Dz mode with respect to \decay{\Bm}{\D(\Km\pip)\Kstarm} and \decay{\Bm}{\D(\Km\pip\pim\pip)\Kstarm} for two- and four-body observables respectively. The \CP observables to be extracted are physical quantities, which are independent of the detection and selection strategies employed. Therefore, in order to extract these \CP observables from the raw yield ratios, various efficiency corrections, taken from simulated signal samples, must be applied.

For the GLW modes, efficiency corrections are applied to the raw value of the yield ratios to extract \Rkk, \Rpipi and \Rpipipipi as shown in Equation \ref{effcorrectionglw2body} and \ref{effcorrectionglw4body}, where $\epsilon_{sel}$ and $\epsilon_{pid}$ are the selection and PID efficiencies respectively. The values for these selection and PID efficiency corrections are given in Tables \ref{seleff} and \ref{pideff} respectively.

{\footnotesize
\begin{equation}
R_{hh} = \frac{N(\decay{\Bm}{\D(h^+h^-)\Kstarm})}{N(\decay{\Bm}{\D(\Km\pip)\Kstarm})} \times \frac{\BR(\decay{\Dz}{\Km\pip})}{\BR(\decay{\Dz}{hh})} \times \frac{\epsilon_{\text{sel}}(K\pi)}{\epsilon_{\text{sel}}(hh)} \times \frac{\epsilon_{\text{pid}}(K\pi)}{\epsilon_{\text{pid}}(hh)}
\label{effcorrectionglw2body}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
R_{\pi\pi\pi\pi} = \frac{N(\decay{\Bm}{\D(\pip\pim\pip\pim)\Kstarm})}{N(\decay{\Bm}{\D(\Km\pip\pim\pip)\Kstarm})} \times \frac{\BR(\decay{\Dz}{\Km\pip\pim\pip})}{\BR(\decay{\Dz}{\pi\pi\pi\pi})} \times \frac{\epsilon_{\text{sel}}(K\pi\pi\pi)}{\epsilon_{\text{sel}}(\pi\pi\pi\pi)} \times \frac{\epsilon_{\text{pid}}(K\pi\pi\pi)}{\epsilon_{\text{pid}}(\pi\pi\pi\pi)} 
\label{effcorrectionglw4body}
\end{equation}}

As the final state in the ADS modes are almost identical to the corresponding charge favoured mode, the selection efficiencies that are common to both are assumed to cancel. There are only two differences between the selection for the ADS mode and the charge favoured mode; the tighter BDT selection for DD candidates and the double misidentification veto, which is only applied to the ADS mode. Equations \ref{effcorrectionads2body} and \ref{effcorrectionads4body} describe the effciency corrections required to extract \Rptwo, \Rmtwo, \Rpfour and \Rmfour from the raw yield ratios, where $\epsilon_{bdt}$ and $\epsilon_{veto}$ are the BDT and veto efficiencies respectively. The values for these BDT and veto efficiency corrections are given in Tables \ref{bdteff} and \ref{vetoeff} respectively.

{\footnotesize
\begin{equation}
R^{\pm}_{K\pi} = \frac{N(\decay{\Bpm}{\D(\Kmp\pipm)\Kstarpm})}{N(\decay{\Bpm}{\D(\Kpm\pimp)\Kstarpm})} \times \frac{\epsilon_{\text{bdt}}(K\pi)}{\epsilon_{\text{bdt}}(\pi K)} \times \frac{1}{\epsilon_{\text{veto}}(\pi K)}
\label{effcorrectionads2body}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
R^{\pm}_{K\pi\pi\pi} = \frac{N(\decay{\Bpm}{\D(\Kmp\pipm\pimp\pipm)\Kstarpm})}{N(\decay{\Bpm}{\D(\Kpm\pimp\pipm\pimp)\Kstarpm})} \times \frac{\epsilon_{\text{bdt}}(K\pi\pi\pi)}{\epsilon_{\text{bdt}}(\pi K\pi\pi)} \times \frac{1}{\epsilon_{\text{veto}}(\pi K\pi\pi)}
\label{effcorrectionads4body}
\end{equation}}

The \CP fit uses Equations \ref{effcorrectionglw2body:effcorrectionads4body} to convert the raw yield ratios into the \CP observables to be extracted. The \CP observables relating to the yield ratios, \Rkk, \Rpipi, \Rptwo,  \Rmtwo \Rpipipipi, \Rpfour and  \Rmfour, are extracted from the fit with all these relevant efficiency corrections applied.

\subsubsection{Signal efficiencies from simulation}
\label{sec:cpfit:efficiencies:signal}

The signal efficiency, $\epsilon_{sel}$, to be used as a correction, as in Equations \ref{effcorrectionglw2body} and \ref{effcorrectionglw4body}, is defined as the probability that a true signal candidate passes the full selection imposed. The signal efficiency is extracted from samples of simulated signal events by calculating the number of signal events that pass the selection as a fraction of those generated. The values are then taken to be used as fixed inputs in the \CP fit. These values have been calculated separately for \runone and \runtwo samples as well as LL and DD categories, as shown in Table \ref{seleff}. It can be seen that the LL selection efficiency drops in \runtwo, this is thought to be due to the \KS momentum being slightly higher in \runtwo giving fewer \KS mesons decay within the \velo. PID efficiencies have not been included in these calculations; they are extracted from the {\tt PIDCalib} package~\cite{PIDCalib} and are detailed in Section \ref{sec:cpfit:efficiencies:pid}.

The BDT signal efficiency is defined as the probability a true signal event passes the BDT selection imposed. The BDT efficiency for the two- and four-body ADS modes is required as a correction, as shown in Equations \ref{effcorrectionads2body} and \ref{effcorrectionads4body}, which is obtained from samples of simulated signal events. The results are given in Table \ref{bdteff}.

\end{tabular}}

\label{bdteff}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{PID efficiencies}
\label{sec:cpfit:efficiencies:pid}

In this analysis the selection for the different \Dz decays modes is almost identical apart for the particle identification requirements. Therefore it is very important to apply an efficient PID selection to remove possible backgrounds containing misidentified particles, as described in Section \ref{sec:selection:pid}. The efficiencies for the various PID selections are determined using background free calibration samples of protons, kaons and pions. PID efficiency is a function of momentum and psuedorapidity, therefore when calculating of the overall PID efficiency, the sample is reweighted based on the momentum and pseudorapidity distribution of the signal candidates. The uncertainties in the PID efficiencies are systematic and come from, the limited size of the calibration samples, the limited size of the simulated signal samples and the reweighting procedure itself.

The PID efficiencies are calculated individually for each year of data-taking and each magnet polarity and are subsequently combined according to the efficiency corrected yields in each of the samples. They are combined separately for \runone and \runtwo. The results of the PID efficienies are given in Table \ref{pideff}. These efficiencies are used in the \CP fit as described in Equations \ref{effcorrectionglw2body} and \ref{effcorrectionglw4body}. 

\begin{table}[h]

\end{tabular}}
\caption{Summary of the PID efficiencies used in the \CP fit}
\label{pideff}
\end{table}

Another input to the fit is the efficiency of the double misidentification veto, which is required as a correction to the ADS observables, as in Equations \ref{effcorrectionads2body} and \ref{effcorrectionads4body}. Veto efficiencies calculated from data are used in the \CP fit for both two- and four-body modes, given in Table \ref{vetoeff}.

\begin{table}[h]

\end{tabular}}
\caption{Summary of the veto efficiencies used in the \CP fit}
\label{vetoeff}
\end{table}

It can be seen from Table \ref{pideff} that the PID efficiency in \runtwo is higher than \runone for the PID selection used in this analysis. In order to check that the PID selection for \runone is suitable to be applied to \runtwo, the misidentification efficiency (efficiency of a \kpi candidate passing the \pik PID selection) was investigated. For the two-body mode, both the PID efficiency and misidentification efficiency is improved in \runtwo compared to \runone so the same PID selection is applied to both datasets. For the four-body mode the misidentification efficiency is slightly worse in \runtwo compared to \runone. A low misidentification rate is required to reduce the crossfeed background discussed in Section \ref{sec:backgrounds:crossfeed}, which reports a negligible level of this crossfeed background in both \runone and \runtwo, therefore the misidentification rate is already sufficiently low and so the PID selection does not need to be tightened for \runtwo.

\subsection{Corrections to asymmetries}
\label{sec:cpfit:asymmetries}

In \CP fit, the data samples are split by charge in order to measure various asymmetries between \Bp and \Bm, namely \Akpi, \Akk, \Apipi and \Apipipipi, as well as yield ratios in \Bp and \Bm samples separately, namely \Rptwo, \Rmtwo, \Rpfour and \Rmfour. Each observed asymmetry in the data fit contains contributions from several effects. Firstly, there is the physics asymmetry due to \CP violation effects, $A_{phys}$, which is the physical parameter to be measured. In order to make an accurate measurement of the physics asymmetries of interest it is necessary to consider and correct for other sources of asymmetry that would affect the measurement. These asymmetries are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Production asymmetry $A_{prod}$: asymmetry in the rate of production of \Bp compared to \Bm mesons in the $pp$ collisions,
\item Detection asymmetry $A_{det}$: asymmetry from differences in the efficiency of the detector for detecting a pion compared to a kaon,
\item PID asymmetry, $A_{pid}$: asymmetry in PID efficiencies between positively charged and negatively charged tracks.
\end{itemize}
These asymmetries all contribute to produce the raw observed asymmetry measured in data,
\begin{equation}
A_{raw} = A_{phys} + A_{prod} + A_{det} + A_{pid} \text{ .}
\label{asymmetries}
\end{equation} 
Corrections are provided for the production asymmetry, detector asymmetry and PID asymmetry such that the \CP fit provides a direct measurement of the physics asymmetries of interest.

\subsubsection{Production asymmetry}

The \Bpm production asymmetry is estimated using the previous measurements of production asymmetries in \runone at \lhcb, binned in $p$ and $\eta$, using \decay{\Bp}{\Dzb\pip} decays~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2016-054}. The production asymmetry is calculated performing a weighted average based on the $p$ and $\eta$ distribution in the simulated signal samples for this analysis. The value obtained is $(-0.61 \pm 0.97) \times 10^{-2}$ for 2011 data and $(-0.52 \pm 0.64) \times 10^{-2}$ for 2012 data. This gives a combined \runone value of $(-0.54 \pm 0.54) \times 10^{-2}$, with the uncertainty applied as a systematic. The equivalent results for \runtwo data are not currently available, as such the production asymmetry for \runtwo is taken to have the same central value as \runone with twice the uncertainty, $(-0.54 \pm 1.08) \times 10^{-2}$. These central values are applied as a fixed correction directly in the \CP fit, and the uncertainties are considered as a source of systematic uncertainty.

\subsubsection{Detection asymmetry}

The detection asymmetry arises from differences of matter and antimatter particles as they travel through the detector. The pion and kaon detection asymmetry are the values of interest, because the \btodkst decay presented in this thesis contains a final state consisting of purely pions and kaons. The pion detection asymmetry has been measured at \lhcb at $(0.08 \pm 0.30)\%$~\cite{pi_det_asym}. However, for the kaon asymmetry the best measured value at \lhcb is not the pure kaon asymmetry, but $A_{K\pi}$, where $A_{K\pi} = A_K - A_{\pi}$, given in bins of kaon momentum. The $K\pi$ asymmetry is calculated performing a weighted average based on the kaon momentum distribution in the simulated signal sample. The value of $A_{K\pi}$ obtained is $(-1.06 \pm 0.16)\%$~\cite{k_det_asym}. The values are obtained using \runone data, but the same results are used for \runtwo data. The changes to the detector between the data-taking periods are not expected to significantly affect the $A_{\text{det}}$ measurement. The total detection asymmetry correction to be applied varies for the different \Dz decay modes, depending on the number of charged kaons and pions in the final state and the \CP observable being measured. Table \ref{detectionasymmetry} summarises the different detection asymmetry factors that apply to each observable. The fixed central values are used in the \CP fit and the uncertainties are in these values are considered as a source of systematic uncertainty.

\end{table}}

\subsubsection{PID asymmetry}

The PID asymmetry arises from the asymmetry of the detector. Due to the \lhcb dipole magnet, positively charged particles are bent in the opposite direction to negatively charged particles, therefore asymmetry in the detector would manifest itself as a different in the detection of positive and negatively charged particles. However, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:detector:tracking}, the direction of the magnetic field in \lhcb is reversed at certain points throught data-taking in order to correct for such effects. Calculting the PID efficiency of the bachelor pion for \Bp and \Bm tracks, allows us to measure any residual PID asymmetry to be included as a correction. Tables \ref{bachpidBminus} and \ref{bachpidBplus} show the bachelor PID efficiency in the \kpi mode for each year, \KS track type and magnet polarity. The values are combined for \runone and \runtwo, weighted by the efficiency corrected yields in each sample. The PID asymmetry $A_{pid}$, defined as,
\begin{equation*}
A_{pid} = \frac{\epsilon_{\pi^-}^{pid} - \epsilon_{\pi^+}^{pid}}{\epsilon_{\pi^-}^{pid} + \epsilon_{\pi^+}^{pid}}
\end{equation*}
is caluclated to be $(-9.56 \pm 0.19) \times 10^{-4}$ for \runone and $(-1.40 \pm 0.05) \times 10^{-4}$ for \runtwo. These central values are included in the \CP fit as a fixed correction to the raw asymmetry, with the uncertainties being considered as a source of systematic uncertainty.

\subsection{Likelihood function}
\label{sec:cpfit:likelihood}

The fit is performed by constructing a likelihoood function that is to be minimised. A likelihood is assigned to each candidate in a given category by constructing the signal and background PDFs. The total log-likelihood is the sum of the log-likelihoods for each of the different categories.

\begin{equation}
\log\mathcal{L} = \sum_{\Bp,\Bm}\sum_{\text{LL,DD}}\mathop{\sum_{\text{Run 1,}}}_{\text{Run 2}} \left( \log\mathcal{L}_{\D\Kstar}^{\text{2-body}} + \log\mathcal{L}_{\D\Kstar}^{\text{4-body}} \right)
\end{equation}

The expression $\log\mathcal{L}_{\D\Kstar}^{\text{2-body}}$ consists of the sum of the log likelihoods for each of the two-body modes, and equivalently for $\log\mathcal{L}_{\D\Kstar}^{\text{4-body}}$. The likelihood for each mode is constructed from the signal, combinatorial and partially reconstructed PDFs, namely $P_{\text{sig}}$, $P_{\text{comb}}$ and $P_{\text{\Dstar\Kstar}}$, respectively, with coresponding yields $N_{\text{sig}}$, $N_{\text{comb}}$ and $N_{\text{\Dstar\Kstar}}$. The two- and four-body log-likelihoods are slightly different due to the different shapes of the signal and combinatorial PDFs. The log-likelihood is given by,

\begin{equation}
\log\mathcal{L}_{\D\Kstar}^{\text{(2/4)-body}} = \mathop{\sum_{\text{(2/4)-body}}}_{\text{modes}} \log\left(N_{\text{sig}}P_{\text{sig}}^{\text{(2/4)-body}} + N_{\text{comb}}P_{\text{comb}}^{\text{(2/4)-body}} + N_{\text{\Dstar\Kstar}}P_{\text{\Dstar\Kstar}}\right) \text{ .}
\label{likelihood}
\end{equation}

The likelihood for  the \decay{\Dz}{\Kp\Km} mode has an additional $N_{\Lambda}P_{\Lambda}$ term from the $\decay{\Lb}{\Lc\Kstar}$ background, discussed in Section \ref{sec:backgrounds:Lb2LcKst}.

The signal yield $N_{\text{sig}}$ in each category is not calculated directly, but from the total signal yield for all categories in the \decay{\Dz}{\Km\pip} mode and the \CP observables.

\subsection{Fitter bias in \CP fit}
\label{sec:cpfit:fitterbias}

Data was generated according to the model described in Section \ref{sec:massfit}, using the yields taken from the single data fits to the favoured two- and four-body modes and \CP parameters were estimated assuming values of $r_B = 0.1$, $\delta_B = 111^o$ and $\gamma = 70^o$. The generated data was then fitted back using the same model and the fit parameters were extracted. This process was repeated 1000 times. The quality of the fit is tested by observing the pull distribution of each fit parameter $x$, which is given by,

\begin{equation*}
P_x = \begin{cases}
	\frac{x_{fit} - x_{gen}}{\sigma_x^-}, & \text{if $x_{fit} - x_{gen} >$ 0}. \\
	\frac{x_{gen} - x_{fit}}{\sigma_x^+}, & \text{if $x_{fit} - x_{gen} <$ 0}.
	\end{cases}
\end{equation*}

where $x_{fit}$ is the value of the parameter returned by the fit, $x_{gen}$ is the generated value of the parameter, and $\sigma_x^+$ and $\sigma_x^-$ are the upper and lower asymmetric errors respectively. The results of the pull distributions for the \CP observables are shown in Figures \ref{pulls1} and \ref{pulls2}. All pull distributions are consistent with a mean of zero and width of 1, therefore, the fit is considered stable and unbiased.

\subsection{Optimisation of BDT and \Kstar selection using toys}
\label{sec:cpfit:optimisation}

The BDT selection, \Kstar mass window and \KS helicity selection were optimised simultaneously with the aim of minimising the uncertainty on the \CP parameters, \Akpi, \Akk, \Apipi, \Rkk, \Rpipi, \Rptwo, \Rmtwo, \Akpipipi, \Apipipipi, \Rpipipipi, \Rpfour and \Rmfour. The selection was applied to data with no \Kstarm selection, i.e. no requirements on the \Kstarm mass or \KS helicity angle, and a loose ($>-0.8$) BDT selection. A single fit was performed to the two- and four-body favoured modes, as in Section \ref{sec:massfit:fit}, to give the expected signal, combinatoric and partially reconstructed yields. The signal and background efficiencies were calculated, from simulation and data, for the various selctions explored:

\begin{itemize}
\item{\Kstar mass window: 100, 75 and 50 MeV}
\item{\textbar cos(\KS helicity angle) \textbar : 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4}
\item{BDT selection: -0.8, -0.6, -0.4, -0.2, 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95}
\end{itemize}

Using the initial yields and efficiencies from simulation, the estimated yields for the various selections were calculated. Pseudoexperiments were generated with the expected yields and efficiencies. For the signal yield, the favoured mode was estimated from the data fit and the yield ratios and asymmetries were inferred from physics parameters using Equations \ref{exp_Acp}, \ref{exp_Rcp} and \ref{exp_Rpm}. For this optimisation process values of $r_B = 0.1$, $\delta_B = 150^{\circ}$ and $\gamma = 70^{\circ}$ were assumed. The value for \Pgamma is taken from the central value of the current \lhcb combination and $r_B$ is assumed to be the same as for \decay{\Bm}{\D\Km}. A value of $\delta_B$ is chosen to be similar to values from previous analysis, although the value is completely unknown. The optimisation was repeated for various values of $\delta_B$ and it was found that the choice of selection is not sensitive to $\delta_B$.

Pseudoexperiments were performed for different selections to calculate the fit uncertainty for each selection. The fit uncertainty was taken to be the mean of the uncertainty distribution. For optimising the selection for the GLW modes, the fit error was minimised for $A_{KK}$, $R_{KK}$, $A_{\pi\pi}$ and $R_{\pi\pi}$. Figure \ref{optimisation} shows an example of the optimisation studies performed. The BDT selection for the ADS modes was optimised to minimise the fit errors in $R^+$ and $R^-$. Studies were performed to investigate a tighter BDT cut for the ADS mode as illustrated in Figure \ref{adsoptimisation}. The tighter BDT cut for DD candidates was chosen as it resulted in a lower uncertainty on $R^+$ and $R^-$ due to a reduction in the background rejection from 7\% to 2\% while retaining 80\% of the signal. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/selection/optimisation.pdf}
\caption{Value of the uncertainty on $R_{KK}$ as a function of \KS helicity angle selection for different \Kstar mass selections. The black curve is using a \Kstar mass window of 100 MeV, the red curve is using a \Kstar mass window of 75 MeV and the blue curve is using a \Kstar mass window of 50 MeV. The minimum uncertainty is given for a \Kstar mass window of 75 MeV and \KS helicity angle of 0.3. This was the \Kstar selection chosen after investigating uncertainties in other variables}
\label{optimisation}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/selection/ADSoptimisation.pdf}
\caption{Value of the uncertainty on $R^+$ and $R^-$ as a function of BDT\_DD cut in the ADS mode. These toys were run with a BDT LL cut of 0.6 on all modes and BDT DD cut of 0.7 on all modes other than the ADS. The black curve is the uncertainty of $R^+$ and the red curve is the uncertainty of $R^-$. Although the uncertainty continues to decrease for a BDT cut of 0.95, this resulted in a significant drop in signal efficiency, therefore a cut of 0.9 was chosen for the ADS}
\label{adsoptimisation}
\end{figure}

In cases when the figure of merits in these optimisation studies were not especially sensitive to changes in the selection, the selection giving the highest coherence, i.e. tighter \Kstarm selection, was chosen. For the BDT selection the signal and background efficiencies were also taken into account. The final selection chosen was:

\begin{itemize}
\item{75 MeV \Kstar mass window}
\item{\textbar cos(\KS helicity angle) \textbar $>$ 0.3}
\item{BDT $>$ 0.6 for LL and 0.7 for DD, except in the ADS mode where BDT $>$ 0.6 for LL and 0.9 for DD}
\end{itemize}

The choice of BDT selection in ADS mode remains optimal when tested against a scenario of low combinatoric in the ADS mode.

\section{Systematics}
\label{sec:systematics}

When performing the \CP fit, uncertainty in the \CP observables arises from statistical fluctuations in the data due to the limited size of the data sample. These uncertainties, shown in Table \ref{cpfitresultsphysics}, are referred to as statistical uncertainty. However, there is an additional source of uncertainty arising from the assumptions involved in the construction of the model and how it is implemented. Assumptions made about the components of the model, as described in Section \ref{sec:massfit}, and inputs calculated prior to the fit, which have an associated uncertainty, are given fixed values, as described in Section \ref{sec:cpfit:setup}. The uncertainty originiating from the construction and implementation of the model is referred to as systematic uncertainty.

In this section, various sources of systematic uncertainty that affect the measurements of \CP observables are investigated. Many fixed parameters are used in the fit model. Each of these fixed inputs has an associated uncertainty which needs to be propagated to the \CP observables giving rise to the systematic uncertainties. Uncertainties from the assumptions made for individual model components used in the \CP fit must also be included. Systematic uncertainties are computed either by multiple fits to data with certain parameters varied or by using pseudoexperiments where the generation is different to the fit model. 

\subsection{Sources of systematic uncertainty}

Branching fractions~\cite{PDG2016}, various efficiencies and asymmetries are used as inputs to the simultaneous fit in order to relate the measured yields to the \CP observables. The systematic uncertainty for these fixed inputs is calculated based on how much the \CP observables are affected by changes on the scale of the uncertainty in the value under investigation. The systematic uncertainties due to the use of fixed inputs from branching ratios, simulation efficiencies, asymmetry corrections and shape parameters are estimated by performing multiple fits to data where each relevant parameter is varied according to a Gaussian distribution with the width as the assigned uncertainty. Any correlations between the parameters are ignored. The standard deviation of the fitted parameter distribution is assigned as the systematic uncertainty. 

Other systematic uncertainties arise from the modelling of the signal and partially reconstructed backgrounds and the effect of any residual charmless \B decays. The systematic uncertainties from these sources are computed by generating pseudoexperiments. In each case the generated model is varied according to the systematic effects being estimated. The systematic uncertainty on each observable is taken to be the difference between the mean of the fitted parameter distribution and the generated value. A summary of the components of the systematic uncertainties for the \CP observables is given in Table~\ref{systematics}.

\subsubsection{Branching ratios}

The branching ratios for the different \D decays are used in the \CP fit as shown in Equations \ref{effcorrectionglw2body} and \ref{effcorrectionglw4body}. The values used for the branching ratios are given in Table \ref{fitinputs} along with their uncertainties~\cite{PDG2014}. A systematic is assigned by performing 1000 fits to data each time varying the branching ratio values by a Gaussian with a width corresponding to the uncertainty of each branching ratio.

\subsubsection{Simulation efficiencies}

Selection efficincies and BDT efficiencies are used in the \CP fit as shown in Equations \ref{effcorrectionglw2body}, \ref{effcorrectionglw4body}, \ref{effcorrectionads2body} and \ref{effcorrectionads4body}. The values used in the \CP fit are shown in Table \ref{fitinputs} along with their uncertainties. These values are fixed in the \CP fit. The \runtwo uncertainties are estimated assuming efficiencies from 2016 simulated samples have the same central value as 2015 but with twice the uncertainty. A systematic is assigned by performing 1000 fits to data each time varying these fixed parameters according to a Gaussian whose width is the assigned unceratinty for that parameter.

\subsubsection{PID efficiencies}

PID efficiencies are used in the \CP fit as shown in Equations \ref{effcorrectionglw2body} and \ref{effcorrectionglw4body} and the values used are shown in Table \ref{fitinputs}. A systematic is assigned by performing 1000 fits to data each time varying the PID efficiencies according to a Gaussian whose width is the assigned unceratinty for that value.

\subsubsection{Veto efficiencies}

Veto efficiencies are required in the \CP fit to correct for the veto applied in the two- and four-body ADS modes, as shown in Equations \ref{effcorrectionads2body} and \ref{effcorrectionads4body}, with the actual values used shown in Tables \ref{fitinputs} as well as the uncertainties. The Run 2 uncertainties are estimated assuming efficiencies from 2016 simulated samples have the same central value as 2015 but with twice the uncertainty. A systematic is assigned by performing 1000 fits to data each time varying the veto efficiencies according to a Gaussian whose width is the assigned unceratinty for that value.

\subsubsection{Asymmetry corrections}

Corrections must be made in the \CP for various sources of asymmetry as detailed in Section \ref{sec:cpfit:asymmetries}, namely production asymmetry, detection asymmetry and PID asymmetry. For each source of asymmetry a correction is applied in the \CP fit and a systematic is assigned separately to each based on the uncertainty of each correction. Details of the values used with their corresponding uncertainties are given in Section \ref{sec:cpfit:asymmetries}. It is worth noting that for production asymmetry, the \runtwo value is taken to have the same central value as Run 1 with double the uncertainty. 

\subsubsection{Signal shape}
\label{sec:systematics:signal}

The signal shape, described in Section \ref{sec:massfit:signal}, is modelled as a Double Crystal Ball with all the parameters fixed from simulation apart from the mean and width. From simualted signal samples it can be seen that the signal shape has more than one characteristic width a low mass tail. There are two sources of unceratinty in the choice of signal shape: the tail parameters, $\alpha$ and $n$, and the width ratio and yield fraction, $f_{\sigma}$ and $f_{cb}$, between the two CBs. These two sources of uncertainty are treated separately and combined. The uncertainty in the tail parameters is quantified by generating 1000 toys with a Double Johnson signal shape, but fitting back with the original fit model. The Double Johnson is taken to have the same width ratio and yield fraction as the Double Crystal Ball used in the \CP fit. The results from this method are given in the first row of Table \ref{signalshapeSystematics}.

For the uncertainty in the width ratio and yield fraction, a systematic is assigned by performing 1000 fits to data each time varying the width ratio and yield fraction according to a Gaussian whose width is the assigned unceratinty for that value, which is taken from the fits to simulated samples, as given in Table \ref{signalparameters}. The results from this method are given in the second row of Table \ref{signalshapeSystematics}.

The systematic from generating a Double Johnson distribution and that from varying the Doule Crystal Ball parameters are added in quadrature to give the total signal shape systematic.

\label{signalshapeSystematics}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Combinatoric}

The shape of the combinatoric is fixed across all \D modes, the statistics are not enough to have the shapes floating. In order to get an idea of the variation in combinatoric shape between different \D modes, fits are performed to the high B mass region (5400 - 5600 \mevcc) using an exponential as the fit model, as shown in Figures \ref{combinatoricLL} and \ref{combinatoricDD}. The data used for these fits is \runone data with stripping and pre-selection applied, except for \Kstar selection and \Dz and \KS FD significance cuts. PID selection on the \D daughters is also applied in order to be sure of accessing the difference between the different \D modes. The full selection was not applied as there is not enough statistics to perform a meaningful fit.

\caption{Fits to the combinatoric background in the high B mass region for DD candidates. The fitted values for the exponential slope parameter are given on each plot.}
\label{combinatoricDD}
\end{figure}

The systematic is assigned by generating 1000 toys with the combinatoric shape parameter for each mode fixed to those given in Figures \ref{combinatoricLL} and \ref{combinatoricDD}, but fitting back with the original fit model.

\subsubsection{Partially reconstructed}
\label{sec:systematics:partreco}

The partially reconstructed decays have a completely fixed shape and yield contributing to the \CP fit. The shape parameters are fixed from fits to simulated samples, yield ratios are fixed from branching ratios and simulation efficiencies and total yield is fixed from the fit to \kpi invariant mass. The estimated yield is divided equally between \Bp and \Bm bins. In order to assign a systematic three different modifications are made to the partially reconstructed region:

\begin{itemize}
\item The yield is incrased by 20\%. The uncertainty in the yield from the fit to \kpi invariant mass is about 5\%, but this is considered to be an underestimate, therefore a conservative systematic of 20\% is used
\item All partially reconstructed shape are smeared by the difference in signal width between simulatied samples and data. The width for all partially reconstructed shapes is increased by 4\% of LL bins and 5\% for DD bins
\item A 10\% asymmetry is introduced for the partially reconstructed shapes
\end{itemize}

These adjustments are applied simultaneously. The systematic is assigned by generating 1000 toys with the above modifications implemented, but fitting back with the original fit model.

\subsubsection{Charmless}

Section \ref{sec:backgrounds:charmless} shows that there is a possibility for residual charmless contribution in \pipi mode. Charmless events in the \pipi mode were generated according to a Gaussian whose mean is the expected number of charmless events and the width is the corresponding unceratinty, as given in Tables \ref{charmlessyields} and \ref{charmlessyieldsRun2}. This value is rounded to a whole number and randomly distributed between \Bp and \Bm as a component of the yield in the signal region. The systematic is assigned by generating 1000 toys with a charmless contrbution introduced, but fitting back with the original fit model.

\subsection{Results of systematic uncertainties}

Table \ref{systematics} summarises the systematics for various different sources. If the systematic unceratinty was found to be more than 2 orders of magntiude smaller than the statistical unceratinty then a value of zero is given. Systematics from MC efficiencies and branching ratios mainly affects $R_{KK}$ and $R_{\pi\pi}$. Production and detection asymmetry systematics contribute to $A_{K\pi}$, $A_{KK}$ and $A_{\pi\pi}$. PID efficiencies and PID asymmetry correction do not contribute much to the systematic uncertainty. The signal shape systematic have a non-negligible effect on the uncertainty for all the physics observables. All systematic uncertainties are smaller than the corresponding statistical uncertainty.

\section{Summary of results}
\label{sec:cpfit:summary}

The \CP observables determined from the fit shown in Figs.~\ref{datafit2bodyRun1} -~\ref{datafit4bodyRun2} are  
\begin{alignat*}{13}
A_{K\pi} &= &\ -&0.004&\ &\pm&\ &0.023&\ &\pm&\ &0.008& \\
A_{KK} &= &&0.06&\ &\pm&\ &0.07&\ &\pm&\ &0.01& \\
A_{\pi\pi} &= &&0.15&\ &\pm&\ &0.13&\ &\pm&\ &0.02& \\
R_{KK} &= &&1.22&\ &\pm&\ &0.09&\ &\pm&\ &0.01& \\
R_{\pi\pi} &= &&1.08&\ &\pm&\ &0.14&\ &\pm&\ &0.03& \\
R^+_{K\pi} &= &&0.020&\ &\pm&\ &0.006&\ &\pm&\ &0.001& \\ 
R^-_{K\pi} &= &&0.002&\ &\pm&\ &0.004&\ &\pm&\ &0.001& \\
A_{K\pi\pi\pi} &= &\ -&0.013&\ &\pm&\ &0.031&\ &\pm&\ &0.009& \\
A_{\pi\pi\pi\pi} &= &&0.02&\ &\pm&\ &0.11&\ &\pm&\ &0.01& \\
R_{\pi\pi\pi\pi} &= &&1.08&\ &\pm&\ &0.13&\ &\pm&\ &0.03& \\
R^+_{K\pi\pi\pi} &= &&0.016&\ &\pm&\ &0.007&\ &\pm&\ &0.003& \\ 
R^-_{K\pi\pi\pi} &= &&0.006&\ &\pm&\ &0.006&\ &\pm&\ &0.004&
\end{alignat*}
where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. The correlation matrices for the statistical and systematic uncertainties are given in Tables~\ref{statisticalcorrelations} and \ref{systematiccorrelations}, respectively. The large correlations of the systematic uncertainties are mainly due to contributions from production and detection asymmetries. Combined results from the \Kp\Km and \pip\pim decay modes, taking correlations into account, are
\begin{alignat*}{13}
R_{\CP+} &= &\ &1.18&\ &\pm&\ &0.08&\ &\pm&\ &0.01& \\
A_{\CP+} &= &\ &0.08&\ &\pm&\ &0.06&\ &\pm&\ &0.01&
\end{alignat*}
where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. In addition, $R^+$ and $R^-$ for the \Kp\pim and \Kp\pim\pip\pim decay modes can be transformed into the more commonly used $R_{ADS} = \left(R^- + R^+\right)/2\ $and \mbox{$A_{ADS} = \left(R^- - R^+\right)/\left(R^- + R^+\right)$}. These results, taking correlations into account, are
\begin{alignat*}{13}
R_{ADS}^{K\pi} &= &\ &0.011&\ &\pm&\ &0.004&\ &\pm&\ &0.001& \\
A_{ADS}^{K\pi} &= &\ -&0.81&\ &\pm&\ &0.17&\ &\pm&\ &0.04& \\
R_{ADS}^{K\pi\pi\pi} &= &\ &0.011&\ &\pm&\ &0.005&\ &\pm&\ &0.003& \\
A_{ADS}^{K\pi\pi\pi} &= &\ -&0.45&\ &\pm&\ &0.21&\ &\pm&\ &0.14&
\end{alignat*}
where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. The measured asymmetries and ratios for the two-body \D meson decay modes are consistent with, and more precise than, the previous measurements from \babar~\cite{BaBarDKstar}.

\chapter{\label{ch:5-cpfit}Fits for \CP observables in two- and four-body decays} 

%\minitoc

In this section the \CP observables are measured by performing an extended maximum likelihood fit to \btodkst candidates in data simultaneously for each \Dz decay mode where the data is split into \Bp and \Bm decays. This fit is referred to as the \CP fit. The mass parameterisation used in the \CP fit is described in \sect\ref{sec:cpfit:model}, before detailing the setup of the \CP fit in \sect\ref{sec:cpfit:setup}. The \CP fit results are given in \sect\ref{sec:cpfit:results}, followed by an outline of the systematic uncertainties in \sect\ref{sec:systematics}. \Sect\ref{sec:cpfit:summary} presents a summary of the results of the \CP observables.

\section{Mass parameterisation of the \CP fit}
\label{sec:cpfit:model}

The mass fit model described in \sect\ref{sec:massfit} is used to model all \Dz modes and \B charges in the \CP fit. However, when generalising the model, developed for the charge combined favoured modes, there must be additional factors taken into consideration, such as \CP violation in the background components and additional sources of backgrounds in other \Dz decay modes.

\subsection{Choice of fit range}
\label{sec:cpfit:range}	

The relative yields for the partially reconstructed decays are fixed in the charge combined mass fit to the favoured modes, as described in \sect\ref{sec:massfit:partreco}. However, the \CP fit is performed to all of the different \Dz modes separated by \B charge. For the favoured \kpi and \kpipipi decays it is reasonable to assume that no \CP violation occurs, i.e. the yield ratios for \Bm and \Bp are the same. However in the other \Dz final states, for example \pik, \CP violation is expected in the partially reconstructed background for which the \CP violation parameters are not known. Therefore, it is not possible make any constraints on the yield ratios in these modes. The fit that would result from fitting six individual yields with an order of magnitude less data would be unstable and this lack of constraint in the low mass region would lead to a large amount of freedom in the combinatorial background, casting doubt that the signal yield were correctly extracted. 

There are a number of advantages to raising the lower range of the mass parameterisation up to 5230~\mevcc, which only removes 0.4\% of signal. Firstly, as the overlap of the partially reconstructed and signal peaks is very small, this removes most of the partially reconstructed background. Performing the \CP fit from 5230~\mevcc avoids the need to fit the various partially reconstructed yields in each of the other \Dz decays modes. The extended mass fit to the favoured modes is required initially in order to estimate the amount of partially reconstructed background above 5230~\mevcc. A further benefit is that low level broad backgrounds, for example \decay{\Bm}{\D\Kstarm\piz} and \decay{\Bd}{\Kp\pim\pip\pim}, which may be present in the range 4900 - 5200~\mevcc do not need to considered as sources of systematic uncertainty. 

\subsection{Partially reconstructed yield in \CP fit}
\label{sec:cpfit:partrecoyields}

The modelling of the partially reconstructed background is described in detail in \sect\ref{sec:massfit:partreco}. The low mass limit in the \CP fit is 5230~\mevcc, which removes almost all of the partially reconstructed background. The shape and yield of the small amount of partially reconstructed background present in all \Dz decay mode categories above 5230~\mevcc is determined and fixed from the fits to data of the \kpi and \kpipipi decays, taking into account the smaller branching fractions of the \Dz decays. \Tab\ref{partrecofixedyields} shows the fixed values of the total partially reconstructed yield in the \CP fit. The assumptions used to determine the fixed yields and shape are evaluated as systematic uncertainties, as discussed in \sect\ref{sec:systematics:partreco}.

\subsection{Additional background component in \kk mass spectrum}
\label{sec:cpfit:Lb2LcKst}

An additional source of background is present in the \kk mass spectrum from \decay{\Lb}{\Lc(p\Km\pip)\Kstarm} decays, described in \sect\ref{sec:backgrounds:Lb2LcKst}. The shape used to model this \decay{\Lb}{\Lc\Kstarm} contribution is a Cruijff PDF, defined as,
\begin{equation}
  P_{\Lambda}(m; \mu,\sigma_L,\sigma_R,\alpha_L,\alpha_R)=
\begin{cases}
    \mathcal{K}_{L} exp \left( -\frac{(m-\mu)^2}{2\sigma_L^2 + \alpha_L(m-\mu)^2} \right) ,     & \text{if } m-\mu < 0, \\
    \mathcal{K}_{R} exp \left( -\frac{(m-\mu)^2}{2\sigma_R^2 + \alpha_R(m-\mu)^2} \right) ,     & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\label{Cruijff}
\end{equation}%
where $\mu$ is the peak position, $\sigma_{L,R}$ are the widths on the left and right sides of the peak, $\alpha_{L,R}$ are modification constants and $\mathcal{K}_{L,R}$ are the normalisation constants required for the PDF. Due to reasons relating to timing and speed of generation, a simulated sample of \decay{\Lb}{\Lc\Kstarm} events is not available. Therefore, the parameters of the PDF are taken from a maximum likelihood fit to a simulated sample of \decay{\Lb}{\Lc\Km} events reconstructed as \decay{\Bm}{\D\Km} events; this PDF is expected to be similar to one taken from a \decay{\Lb}{\Lc\Kstarm} sample, and any uncertainty in the shape is accounted for as a systematic uncertainty, described in \sect\ref{sec:systematics}.

A maximum likelihood fit, as described in \sect\ref{sec:massfit:likelihood}, is performed to the \Bm mass spectrum of the simulated sample. This fit is shown in \fig\ref{Lbfit}, where it can be seen that the reconstructed \Bm mass falls between 4800 and 5500~\mevcc. The results from this fit are shown in \tab\ref{fitresultsLb}. All the values for the shape parameters are fixed in the simultaneous fit to the values in \tab\ref{fitresultsLb}.

\end{figure}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\hline
Parameter & Value \\
\hline
$\mu$/\mevcc & $5280 \pm 18$ \\
$\sigma_L$/\mevcc & $221 \pm 26$ \\

\end{tabular}
\caption{Shape parameters from a maximum likelihood fit to simulated \decay{\Lb}{\Lc\Km} events using a Cruijff PDF. These shape parameters are fixed in the \CP fit.}
\label{fitresultsLb}
\end{table}

The PDF is assumed to be the same in each \kk category of the \CP fit, given by the \KS reconstruction type (LL and DD) and data-taking period (Run 1 and Run 2), because there is such a low number of events that contribute to this background that the possible variations in the shape in the different categories has negligible effect on the results. The \decay{\Lb}{\Lc(p\kaon\pi)\Kstarm} yield as a fraction of the signal yield in the favoured \kpi mode, $f_{\Lambda}$, is allowed to vary in the simultaneous fit. This fractional yield is required to be the same for all fit categories.

\section{Setup of \CP fit}
\label{sec:cpfit:setup}

The \CP fit is performed on the invariant mass of \btodkst candidates. A simultaneous fit strategy is employed to fit each of the 7 \Dz decay modes as well as two bins of \B charge (\Bp and \Bm), two bins of \KS reconstruction type (LL and DD) and two bins of data type (\runone and \runtwo), resulting in 56 bins in total. The parameters extracted from this simultaneous fit are the \CP observables: \Akpi, \Akk, \Apipi, \Rkk, \Rpipi, \Rptwo, \Rmtwo, \Akpipipi, \Apipipipi, \Rpipipipi, \Rpfour and \Rmfour, which relate to the physics parameters of interest as shown in \eqns\ref{exp_Acp} - \ref{exp_R4pi}. The \CP observables that are measured relate to the ratios of yields in different \Dz modes and different \B meson charges, therefore it is necessary to separate the data samples associated with each of the modes and charges. By performing the fit to these data samples simultaneously, parameters can be constrained in the higher yielding modes and shared in the other modes.

The simultaneous fit extracts the \CP observables directly, rather than measuring the pure yields and subsequently converting them into the \CP observables. This strategy avoids the need to deal with combining results from different categories, which is complicated due to the many correlations between the variables. 

\subsection{Asymmetry corrections}
\label{sec:cpfit:asymmetries}

Raw asymmetries calculated directly from the yields contain contributions from several effects. Firstly, there is the physics asymmetry due to \CP violation effects, $A_{\text{phys}}$, which is the physical parameter to be measured. In order to make an accurate measurement of the physics asymmetries of interest it is necessary to consider and correct for other sources of asymmetry that would affect the measurement. These asymmetries are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Production asymmetry $A_{\text{prod}}$: asymmetry in the rate of production of \Bp compared to \Bm mesons in the $pp$ collisions,
\item Detection asymmetry $A_{\text{det}}$: asymmetry from differences in the efficiency of the detector for detecting a positively charged particle compared to a negatively charge particle.
\end{itemize}
These asymmetries all contribute to produce the raw observed asymmetry measured in data, $A_{\text{raw}}$, therefore the physical asymmetry is given by,
\begin{equation}
A_{\text{phys}} = A_{\text{raw}} - A_{\text{prod}} - A_{\text{det}} \text{ .}
\label{asymmetries}
\end{equation} 
The detection asymmetry also affects the charge dependent yield ratios in the ADS modes. 

\subsubsection{Production asymmetry}

The \Bpm production asymmetry is estimated using the measurements of production asymmetries in \runone at \lhcb, binned in $p$ and $\eta$, using \decay{\Bp}{\Dzb\pip} decays~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2016-054}. The production asymmetry for \btodkst is calculated by performing a weighted average based on the $p$ and $\eta$ distribution in the simulated signal samples. The value obtained is $A_{\text{prod}} = (-0.54 \pm 0.54) \times 10^{-2}$. The equivalent result for \runtwo data are not currently available, therefore the production asymmetry for \runtwo is taken to have the same central value as \runone in the absence of other information. 

\subsubsection{Detection asymmetry}

The detection asymmetry arises from differences in interactions of matter and antimatter particles with the matter detector. The \btodkst decay contains a final state consisting of purely pions and kaons, therefore the pion and kaon detection asymmetry are the values of interest. The pion detection asymmetry has been measured at \lhcb to be $(0.08 \pm 0.30)\%$~\cite{pi_det_asym}. However, for the kaon asymmetry the best measured value at \lhcb is not the pure kaon asymmetry, but $A_{K\pi} = A_K - A_{\pi}$, where $A_K$ is the pure kaon asymmetry and $A_{\pi}$ is the pure pion asymmetry. The $K\pi$ asymmetry has been measured in bins of kaon momentum~\cite{k_det_asym}, therefore the value of $A_{K\pi}$ for \btodkst is calculated performing a weighted average based on the kaon momentum distribution in the simulated signal sample. The value of $A_{K\pi}$ obtained is $(-1.06 \pm 0.16)\%$. Both $A_{\pi}$ and $A_{K\pi}$ values are obtained using \runone data. The changes to the detector between the data-taking periods are not expected to significantly affect the $A_{\text{det}}$ measurement, therefore the same results are applied to \runone and \runtwo data. 

The detection asymmetry must be corrected for any \CP observable that is sensitive to the charge of the \B meson decay. Therefore, it affects both the asymmetries and the yield ratios in the ADS modes, which are considered separately for \Bm and \Bp. The total detection asymmetry correction to be applied varies for the different \CP observables, depending on the number of charged kaons and pions in the final state and the structure of the \CP observable being measured. \Tab\ref{detectionasymmetry} summarises the different detection asymmetry factors that apply to each observable. The correction for the asymmetries is additive as given in \eqn\ref{asymmetries}, however, when dealing with the yield ratios the correction is a ratio of efficiencies, which must be multiplied by the raw yield ratio to correct for the detection asymmetry effect.

\subsection{Corrections to yield ratios}
\label{sec:cpfit:efficiencies}

The \CP observables related to the ratio of yields, \Rkk, \Rpipi, \Rptwo, \Rmtwo, \Rpipipipi, \Rpfour and \Rmfour, are physical quantities, which are independent of the detection and selection strategies employed. Therefore, in order to extract these \CP observables from the raw yield ratios, various efficiency corrections, taken from simulated signal samples, must be applied.

For the GLW and qGLW modes, efficiency corrections are applied to the raw value of the yield ratios to extract \Rkk, \Rpipi and \Rpipipipi, given by 

{\footnotesize
\begin{equation}
R_{hh} = \frac{N(\decay{\Bm}{\D(h^+h^-)\Kstarm})}{N(\decay{\Bm}{\D(\Km\pip)\Kstarm})} \times \frac{\BR(\decay{\Dz}{\Km\pip})}{\BR(\decay{\Dz}{hh})} \times \frac{\epsilon_{\text{sel}}(K\pi)}{\epsilon_{\text{sel}}(hh)} \times \frac{\epsilon_{\text{pid}}(K\pi)}{\epsilon_{\text{pid}}(hh)} \text{ ,}
\label{effcorrectionglw2body}
\end{equation}
\begin{multline}
R_{\pi\pi\pi\pi} = \frac{N(\decay{\Bm}{\D(\pip\pim\pip\pim)\Kstarm})}{N(\decay{\Bm}{\D(\Km\pip\pim\pip)\Kstarm})} \times \frac{\BR(\decay{\Dz}{\Km\pip\pim\pip})}{\BR(\decay{\Dz}{\pi\pi\pi\pi})} \\ \times \frac{\epsilon_{\text{sel}}(K\pi\pi\pi)}{\epsilon_{\text{sel}}(\pi\pi\pi\pi)} \times \frac{\epsilon_{\text{pid}}(K\pi\pi\pi)}{\epsilon_{\text{pid}}(\pi\pi\pi\pi)} \text{ ,}
\label{effcorrectionglw4body}
\end{multline}}%
where $\epsilon_{\text{sel}}$ and $\epsilon_{\text{pid}}$ are the selection and PID efficiencies respectively. Selection and PID efficiencies are considered separately as PID variables are poorly modelled in \lhcb simulation, therefore a separate, data-driven method for determining PID efficiencies is employed, as detailed in \sect\ref{sec:cpfit:efficiencies:pid}.

As the final states in the ADS modes are almost identical to the corresponding charge favoured modes, the selection efficiencies that are common to both are assumed to cancel. There are only two differences between the selection for the ADS mode and the charge favoured mode: the tighter BDT selection for DD candidates and the double misidentification veto, which is only applied to the ADS mode. The efficiency corrections required to extract \Rptwo, \Rmtwo, \Rpfour and \Rmfour from the raw yield ratios are given by, 

{\footnotesize
\begin{equation}
R^{\pm}_{K\pi} = \frac{N(\decay{\Bpm}{\D(\Kmp\pipm)\Kstarpm})}{N(\decay{\Bpm}{\D(\Kpm\pimp)\Kstarpm})} \times \frac{\epsilon_{\text{bdt}}(K\pi)}{\epsilon_{\text{bdt}}(\pi K)} \times \frac{1}{\epsilon_{\text{veto}}(\pi K)} \times A_{\text{det}}(\pi K) \text{ ,}
\label{effcorrectionads2body}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
R^{\pm}_{K\pi\pi\pi} = \frac{N(\decay{\Bpm}{\D(\Kmp\pipm\pimp\pipm)\Kstarpm})}{N(\decay{\Bpm}{\D(\Kpm\pimp\pipm\pimp)\Kstarpm})} \times \frac{\epsilon_{\text{bdt}}(K\pi\pi\pi)}{\epsilon_{\text{bdt}}(\pi K\pi\pi)} \times \frac{1}{\epsilon_{\text{veto}}(\pi K\pi\pi)} \times A_{\text{det}}(\pi K\pi\pi) \text{ ,}
\label{effcorrectionads4body}
\end{equation}}
where $\epsilon_{\text{bdt}}$ and $\epsilon_{\text{veto}}$ are the BDT and veto efficiencies respectively, and $A_{\text{det}}$ is the detection asymmetry correction discussed in \sect\ref{sec:cpfit:asymmetries}.

The \CP observables relating to the yield ratios, \Rkk, \Rpipi, \Rptwo,  \Rmtwo \Rpipipipi, \Rpfour and  \Rmfour, are extracted from the \CP fit with all these relevant efficiency corrections applied.

\subsubsection{Signal efficiencies from simulation}
\label{sec:cpfit:efficiencies:signal}

The signal efficiency, $\epsilon_{\text{sel}}$, defined as the probability that a true signal candidate passes the full selection imposed, is extracted from samples of simulated signal events by calculating the number of signal events that pass the selection as a fraction of those generated. The values are then taken to be used as fixed inputs in the \CP fit according to \eqns\ref{effcorrectionglw2body} and \ref{effcorrectionglw4body}. These values have been calculated separately for \runone and \runtwo samples as well as LL and DD categories, as shown in \tab\ref{seleff}. It can be seen that the LL selection efficiency drops in \runtwo, which is attributed to the \KS momentum being slightly higher in \runtwo giving fewer \KS mesons decay within the \velo.

The BDT signal efficiency, defined as the probability a true signal event passes the BDT selection imposed, is calculated as the number of events that pass the BDT selection compared to the number that already pass the stripping and mass requirements. The results are given in \tab\ref{bdteff}. These efficiencies, obtained from samples of simulated signal events, are used as fixed inputs in the \CP fit according to \eqns\ref{effcorrectionads2body} and \ref{effcorrectionads4body}.

\label{bdteff}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{PID efficiencies}
\label{sec:cpfit:efficiencies:pid}

The selection for the different \Dz decays modes is almost identical apart for the PID requirements. The PID power of the detector for hadrons originates primarily from the \rich detectors~\cite{LHCb-DP-2012-003,richrun2}. As PID variables are poorly modelled in \lhcb simulation, the efficiencies for the various PID selections are determined from data using calibration samples containing a known particle type for protons, kaons and pions~\cite{LHCb-PUB-2016-021,LHCb-PUB-2016-005}. PID efficiency varies as a function of momentum and pseudorapidity, therefore when calculating the overall PID efficiency, the calibration sample is reweighted based on the momentum and pseudorapidity distribution of the signal candidates. The uncertainties in the PID efficiencies come from, the limited size of the calibration samples, the limited size of the simulated signal samples, the reweighting procedure itself and the effective purity of the calibration samples.

The PID efficiencies are calculated individually for each year of data-taking and each magnet polarity and are subsequently combined according to the efficiency corrected yields in each of the samples. The results of the PID efficiencies are given in \tab\ref{pideff}. These efficiencies are used as fixed inputs in the \CP fit as described in \eqns\ref{effcorrectionglw2body} and \ref{effcorrectionglw4body}. 

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
\begin{tabular}{c|cc|cc}
\hline
& \multicolumn{2}{c}{Run 1} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Run 2} \\
& LL & DD & LL & DD \\
\hline
$\epsilon_{\text{pid}}(K\pi)$ & $0.734 \pm 0.002$ & $0.747 \pm 0.002$ & $0.811 \pm 0.002$ & $0.821 \pm 0.002$ \\
$\epsilon_{\text{pid}}(KK)$ & $0.812 \pm 0.002$ & $0.825 \pm 0.002$ & $0.844 \pm 0.002$ & $0.853 \pm 0.002$ \\
$\epsilon_{\text{pid}}(\pi\pi)$ & $0.670 \pm 0.002$ & $0.676 \pm 0.002$ & $0.779 \pm 0.002$ & $0.790 \pm 0.002$ \\
$\epsilon_{\text{pid}}(K\pi\pi\pi)$ & $0.630 \pm 0.002$ & $0.636 \pm 0.002$ & $0.784 \pm 0.002$ & $0.798 \pm 0.002$ \\
$\epsilon_{\text{pid}}(\pi\pi\pi\pi)$ & $0.675 \pm 0.002$ & $0.687 \pm 0.002$ & $0.822 \pm 0.002$ & $0.835 \pm 0.002$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}}
\caption{Summary of the PID efficiencies used in the \CP fit.}
\label{pideff}
\end{table}

It can be seen from \tab\ref{pideff} that the PID efficiency in \runtwo is higher than \runone for the PID selection used in this analysis. This is primarily due to the removal of the aerogel radiator in \runtwo, which is discussed in \sect\ref{sec:detector:rich}. 

\subsubsection{Veto efficiencies}
\label{sec:cpfit:efficiencies:veto}

Another input to the fit is the efficiency of the double misidentification veto used in \eqns\ref{effcorrectionads2body} and \ref{effcorrectionads4body}. The veto efficiency, defined as the probability a true signal event passes the veto selection, is calculated as the number of events in data that pass the veto selection compared to the number that pass the rest of the selection~\footnote{For the four-body modes, the efficiency is calculated compared to the number that pass the selection before BDT and PID requirements. This inconsistency results in smaller uncertainties on the four-body veto efficiencies, as they are calculated from a larger sample, however it has no significant effect on the final results.}. The values of the veto efficiencies are given in \tab\ref{vetoeff}.

\subsection{Likelihood function}
\label{sec:cpfit:likelihood}

The \CP fit involves performing an extended maximum likelihood fit, as described in \sect\ref{sec:massfit:likelihood}, in order to extract the \CP observables. A likelihood is assigned to each candidate in a given category by constructing the signal and background PDFs. The total extended log-likelihood, $\log\mathcal{L}_{\text{tot}}$, is the sum of the extended log-likelihoods for the individual candidates in each of the different categories: \B charge (\mbox{$\{+,-\}$}, indexed $q$), \KS reconstruction type (\mbox{\{LL, DD\}}, indexed $t$), data type (\mbox{\{Run 1, Run 2\}}, indexed $r$) and \Dz decay mode (\{\Km\pip, \Km\Kp, \pim\pip, \pim\Kp, \Km\pip\pim\pip, \pim\pip\pim\pip, \pim\Kp\pim\pip\}), indexed $m$). This is described by,
\begin{equation}
\log\mathcal{L}_{\text{tot}} =  \sum_{m}\sum_{q}\sum_{t}\sum_{r}\left[\sum_{x_i} \log{\mathcal{L}}_{m,t,r}^q\left( \theta, N; x_i \right) \right] \text{ , }
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ are the set of parameters that describe the shapes of the PDFs in the model,
\begin{multline}
\theta = \{\mu_\text{two-body}, \sigma_\text{two-body}, \mu_\text{four-body}, \sigma_\text{four-body}, \\ \beta_\text{two-body LL}, \beta_\text{two-body DD}, \beta_\text{four-body LL}, \beta_\text{four-body DD}\} \text{ , }
\end{multline} 
and $N$ are the set of parameters relating to the expected number of events described by each PDF, 
\begin{multline}
N = \{\Akpi, \Akk, \Apipi, \Akpipipi, \Apipipipi, \Rkk, \Rpipi, \Rptwo, \Rmtwo, \\ \Rpipipipi, \Rpfour, \Rmfour, \{N_{K\pi,t,r}\}, \{N_{K\pi\pi\pi,t,r}\}, \{N_{comb,m,t,r}^{q}\}\} \text{ . }
\end{multline}
Here $N_{m,t,r}$ refers to the expected signal yield summed over charge in the bin and $N_{comb,m,t,r}^q$ refers to the expected combinatorial yield in each of the 56 bins. The parameter $x_i$ is  the reconstructed mass of a given candidate.

The extended likelihood for each bin is constructed from the model containing the signal, combinatorial and partially reconstructed PDFs: $P_{\text{sig}}$, $P_{\text{comb}}$ and $P_{\text{dstkst}}$, respectively, and information about the expected number of events described by each of the PDFs, as described in \sect\ref{sec:massfit}. The extended likelihood functions for each of the bins is given by,
\begin{multline}
\mathcal{L}_{K\pi, t, r}^{\pm} = \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{\boldsymbol N_{K\pi, t, r}}\left(1 \mp \mathbf{\boldsymbol \Akpi}\right)P_{\text{sig}}\left(\mathbf{\boldsymbol\mu_\text{\textbf{two-body}}},\mathbf{\boldsymbol\sigma_\text{\textbf{two-body}}}\right) + \\ \mathbf{\boldsymbol N_{\textbf{comb}, K\pi, t, r}^{\pm}}P_{\text{comb}}\left(\mathbf{\boldsymbol\beta_\text{\textbf{two-body, t}}}\right) + \frac{1}{2}N_{\text{dstkst}, K\pi, t, r}P_{\text{dstkst}, t}

where the parameters in bold are measured in the fit and the index $\pm$ refers to the different bins of \B charge. The signal yields are constructed as a function of the asymmetries, yield ratios and yields in the favoured mode, therefore it is these quantities that are freely varying parameters to be optimised in the \CP fit. The combinatorial yields in each of the 56 bins are included as a freely varying parameters, however the partially reconstructed yields, $N_{\text{dstkst}, m, t, r}$, which are summed over charge in each bin are fixed, as described in \sect\ref{sec:cpfit:partrecoyields}. The parameters $A_{m, \text{raw}}$ and $R_{m, \text{raw}}$ are the raw asymmetries and yield ratios without any of the corrections discussed in Secs.~\ref{sec:cpfit:asymmetries} and \ref{sec:cpfit:efficiencies} applied. The parameters relate to the \CP observables by
\begin{equation}
A_{m, \text{raw}} = A_m - A_{\text{prod}} - A_{m, \text{det}} \text{ ,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
R_{m, \text{raw}}^{(\pm)} = \epsilon_{m, \text{corr}}R_m^{(\pm)} \text{ ,}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon_{m, \text{corr}}$ refers to the relevant efficiency correction given in \eqns\ref{effcorrectionglw2body} - \ref{effcorrectionads4body}, and $A_{m, \text{det}}$ refers to the mode-dependent corrections due to the detection asymmetry given in \tab\ref{detectionasymmetry}.

\subsection{Optimisation of BDT and \Kstar selection}
\label{sec:cpfit:optimisation}

To select \btodkst events, a BDT is implemented and selection requirements are applied to the \Kstarm mass and \KS helicity angle to preferentially select events that proceed via a \Kstarm meson, as described in \sect\ref{sec:selection}. These selection requirements are optimised simultaneously with the aim of minimising the uncertainty on the \CP observables. 

In order to perform this optimisation procedure, the sensitivity is investigated in pseudoexperiments. To setup each pseudoexperiment the selection is applied to data excluding any requirements on the \Kstarm mass or \KS helicity angle, and with only a loose BDT selection, requiring the BDT classifier to be greater than $-0.8$. With this setup, a single fit was performed to the two- and four-body favoured modes, similar to the fit in \sect\ref{sec:massfit:fit}, to extract the signal, combinatorial and partially reconstructed yields. Signal and background yields under other selection scenarios are then determined via these yields and the signal and background efficiencies. The selections explored are:

\begin{itemize}
\item{The reconstructed \Kstarm mass lies within 50~\mevcc, 75~\mevcc, 100~\mevcc of the known \Kstarm mass,}
\item{The magnitude of $\cos(\theta_{\KS})$ is greater than: 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4,}
\item{The BDT classifier is greater than: -0.8, -0.6, -0.4, -0.2, 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95.}
\end{itemize}

The central value of the yields in the other \Dz decay modes are extracted using the yield ratios and asymmetries, which are calculated based the physics parameters, $r_B$, $\delta_B$ and \Pgamma, using \eqns\ref{exp_Acp} - \ref{exp_R4pi}. For this study values of $r_B = 0.1$, $\delta_B = 150^{\circ}$ and $\gamma = 70^{\circ}$ were assumed, where \Pgamma and $r_B$ are consistent with the best knowledge. Although the value of $\delta_B$ is completely unknown, the optimisation was repeated for various values of $\delta_B$ and it was found that the choice of selection is not sensitive to $\delta_B$. 

For a given selection, pseudoexperiment samples are generated for each of the bins according to the model described and then by performing the \CP fit on the generated data, the \CP observables and their uncertainty are extracted. This process is repeated 1000 times for the same selection, where each time the generated yields take a different value, drawn from the same Poisson distribution resulting in distributions of the \CP observables and their uncertainties. The fit uncertainty is taken to be the mean of the uncertainty distribution. These pseudoexperiments are performed for each of the different selections to calculate the fit uncertainty for each selection scenario.  

For optimising the selection for the GLW modes, the fit uncertainty was minimised for \Akk, \Rkk, \Apipi and \Rpipi. \Fig\ref{optimisation} shows the fit uncertainty in \Rkk as a function of the \KS helicity angle selection point, for different \Kstarm mass requirements. The minimum uncertainty is achieved by requiring the reconstructed \Kstarm mass to lie within 75~\mevcc of the known \Kstarm mass and the magnitude of the \KS helicity angle to be greater than 0.3. A similar study is performed on the \CP observables \Akk, \Apipi and \Rpipi, and these are found show reasonable agreement with the minimum indicated in \fig\ref{optimisation}. This minimum corresponds to the \Kstarm requirements chosen for the final selection. Similarly, the requirement on the BDT classifier is chosen to be greater than 0.6 for LL candidates and 0.7 for DD candidates. The BDT selection for the ADS modes was optimised to minimise the fit errors in \Rptwo and \Rmtwo. Studies were performed to investigate a tighter BDT selection for the ADS mode as illustrated in \fig\ref{adsoptimisation}, showing that the uncertainty in \Rptwo continues to decrease as the BDT requirement is tightened. A tighter BDT cut of 0.9 in the ADS mode for DD candidates was chosen as it resulted in a lower uncertainty on \Rptwo and \Rmtwo due to a increase in the background rejection from 93\% to 98\%, while retaining 80\% of the signal. Although the uncertainty appears to decrease for a BDT cut of 0.95, this tighter selection results in a significant drop in signal efficiency to 73\%. The apparent small drop in uncertainty between 0.9 and 0.95 is not considered significant enough to compensate for such a large drop in signal efficiency. The final selection chosen is:

\begin{itemize}
\item{The reconstructed \Kstarm mass must lie within 75~\mevcc of the known \Kstarm mass.}
\item{The magnitude of $\cos(\theta_{\KS})$ is required to be greater than 0.3}
\item{The BDT classifier is required to be greater than 0.6 for LL candidates and greater than 0.7 for DD candidates, except in the ADS mode where it is required to be greater than 0.6 for LL candidates and 0.9 for DD candidates.}
\end{itemize}

\label{adsoptimisation}
\end{figure}

The pseudoexperiments described in this section were originally generated with an equal combinatorial rate in each of the \Dz decay modes. However, a significantly lower combinatorial rate is observed in data in the ADS modes compared to the corresponding favoured \kpi and \kpipipi modes. Consequently, the sensitivity to changes in the combinatorial rate are investigated. The choice of BDT selection for the ADS modes is found to remain optimal when tested against a scenario of the observed low combinatorial in the ADS modes. 

\subsection{Fitter bias in \CP fit}
\label{sec:cpfit:fitterbias}

The validity of the \CP fit is investigated by testing for any biases, incorrect determination of the uncertainties, or instability in the \CP fit procedure. Pseudoexperiments are performed using the same procedure described in \sect\ref{sec:cpfit:optimisation}, however in this case they are performed based on the final selection only using physics parameters $r_B = 0.1$, $\delta_B = 111^{\circ}$ and $\gamma = 70^{\circ}$. The results of the fit are found to have little sensitivity to the chosen value of $\delta_B$. The \CP fit is performed 1000 times, where each time the value of each the \CP observables and their associated uncertainty is extracted. The validity of the fit is tested by observing the pull distribution of each fit parameter $x$, which is given by,
\begin{equation*}
P_x = \begin{cases}
	\frac{x_{\text{fit}} - x_{\text{gen}}}{\sigma_x^-}, & \text{if } x_{\text{fit}} - x_{\text{gen}} > 0. \\
	\frac{x_{\text{gen}} - x_{\text{fit}}}{\sigma_x^+}, & \text{if } x_{\text{fit}} - x_{\text{gen}} < 0.
	\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
where $x_{\text{fit}}$ is the value of the parameter returned by the fit, $x_{\text{gen}}$ is the generated value of the parameter, and $\sigma_x^+$ and $\sigma_x^-$ are the upper and lower asymmetric uncertainties respectively. These asymmetric uncertainties are determined as described in \sect\ref{sec:massfit:likelihood}. The pull distributions for each of the \CP observables are shown in \fig\ref{pulls}, where for each of the pull distributions a Gaussian fit is performed. All of these fitted Gaussians are all consistent with a mean of zero and width of one, which shows that the setup of the \CP fit is unbiased and the uncertainties are correctly determined. Additionally, all of the fits converge, therefore the fit is stable.

\section{Fit results}
\label{sec:cpfit:results}

The \CP fit is performed on data, with mass projections shown in Figs.~\ref{results2body} and \ref{results4body}. These projections are summed across all \KS reconstruction types and data types after the fit is performed for ease of illustration. \Fig\ref{results2body} shows a slight asymmetry in the \kk and \pipi and \pik modes, with the asymmetry in the \pik mode occurring in the opposite direction. The four-body modes, shown in \fig\ref{results4body}, display the same characteristics, but with fewer events. Using \eqns\ref{exp_Acp} - \ref{exp_Rpm4body}, these observations indicate that the value of \deltab is expected to lie in the region satisfying $\sin\deltab > 0$ and $\cos\deltab >0$. 

\Tab\ref{cpfitresultsphysics} shows the \CP fit results for the \CP observables of interest. There is no significant asymmetry observed in the GLW and quasi-GLW modes, i.e. \Akk, \Apipi and \Apipipipi are all consistent with zero. However, asymmetry can be seen in the two-body ADS mode, where \Rptwo is significantly larger than \Rmtwo. The four-body ADS mode shows a similar behaviour, however the asymmetry is less significant. It can also be seen that \Akpi and \Akpipipi are consistent with zero, as expected due to the very low level of interference in these modes. Additionally, \Akk and \Apipi are in agreement with each other and \Rkk and \Rpipi are in agreement with each other, which is consistent with expectation.

\Tab\ref{cpfitresultsshapes} shows the fit results for the favoured \kpi and \kpipipi signal yields and the shape parameters. It can be seen that both the mean and the width of the signal peak in the two-body and four-body modes are consistent with each other. The yields are significantly higher in \runtwo compared to \runone even though the integrated luminosity in \runtwo is lower. In fact, the yield per unit of integrated luminosity is about 3 times higher in \runone compared to \runtwo, which is driven by the increase in centre-of-mass energy in \runtwo. 

All the combinatorial yields are left to vary in the \CP fit for each of the different bins, and they are found to be consistent between \Bm and \Bp, as expected. However, there is a significantly higher combinatorial yield in the \kpi mode compared to the \pik mode. This difference is also observed between the \kpipipi and \pikpipi modes, but to a lesser extent. This observed difference in background level is consistent with a significant fraction of the combinatorial background coming from \decay{\Bm}{\D\pim X} decays combined with a real but unrelated \KS meson. 

The fitted signal yields obtained from running the fit with \Bp and \Bm samples combined are given in \tab\ref{fittedyields}. When comparing the ratio of the two-body signal yields with the favoured mode, with the ratio of the branching fractions of the different \Dz modes, it can be observed that the results are consistent with the branching fractions. For the four-body modes, the ratio of \kpipipi to \pipipipi signal yield is consistent with their relative branching fractions.

\section{Systematic uncertainty}
\label{sec:systematics}

There is second source of uncertainty, in addition to the statistical uncertainty, arising from the assumptions involved in the construction and implementation of the model, referred to as the systematic uncertainty. In this section, various sources of systematic uncertainty that affect the measurements of the \CP observables are investigated. 

\subsection{Sources of systematic uncertainty}

Systematic uncertainties are calculated via two different methods. The method chosen in each case depends on the nature of the assumption being tested, as well as the information available. 

The first method (Method 1) involves determining the systematic uncertainty in data, whereby some input is adjusted. Sources of systematic uncertainty calculated via this method are those that arise due to the use of fixed inputs in the \CP fit. This method aims to quantify the amount by which the \CP observables are affected by changes to these inputs on the scale of their associated uncertainty. The value of the input is drawn from a Gaussian distribution that has mean corresponding to the central value of the input, as used in the nominal fit, and a width corresponding to the uncertainty in that value. In cases where parameters are varied simultaneously, any correlations between the parameters are ignored. Each time the \CP fit is performed a value for each of the fitted parameters is extracted, resulting in a distribution for each \CP observable. The standard deviation of each of these distributions is taken to be the systematic uncertainty for that \CP observable. 

The second method (Method 2) involves estimating the systematic uncertainty using pseudoexperiments, as described in \sect\ref{sec:cpfit:optimisation}. For each of these systematic effects being investigated, the generated model is varied to account for the corresponding model assumption. The systematic uncertainty on each observable is taken to be the difference between the mean of the fitted parameter distribution from pseudoexperiments and the generated value. Sources of systematic uncertainty calculated via this method are those where Method 1 cannot be used.

Each of the sources of systematic uncertainty, from both fixed inputs and model components, is described individually in the following sections. A summary of the systematic uncertainties for the \CP observables is given in \tab\ref{systematics}.

\subsubsection{Branching ratios}

The branching ratios for the different \Dz decays are used in the \CP fit as shown in \eqns\ref{effcorrectionglw2body} and \ref{effcorrectionglw4body}. \Tab\ref{BR} gives the values of the branching ratios along with their uncertainties. The systematic uncertainty due to using the branching ratios as fixed inputs in the \CP fit is calculated using Method 1, where the uncertainties in the branching ratios are used as the scale of the variation in the corresponding input.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
\hline
Mode & Branching ratio \\
\hline
$\mathcal{B}(\decay{\Dz}{\Km\pip})$ & $0.0393 \pm 0.0004$ \\
$\mathcal{B}(\decay{\Dz}{\Kp\Km})$ & $0.00401 \pm 0.00007$ \\
$\mathcal{B}(\decay{\Dz}{\pip\pim})$ & $0.001421 \pm 0.000025$ \\
$\mathcal{B}(\decay{\Dz}{\Km\pip\pim\pip})$ & $0.0811 \pm 0.0015$ \\
$\mathcal{B}(\decay{\Dz}{\pip\pim\pip\pim})$ & $0.00745 \pm 0.00020$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Branching ratios for the different \Dz decay modes, which are used as fixed inputs in the \CP fit~\cite{PDG2014}.}
\label{BR}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Simulation efficiencies}

Selection efficiencies and BDT efficiencies are used in the \CP fit as shown in \eqns\ref{effcorrectionglw2body}, \ref{effcorrectionglw4body}, \ref{effcorrectionads2body} and \ref{effcorrectionads4body}. The values used in the \CP fit are shown in Tabs.~\ref{seleff} and \ref{bdteff} along with their uncertainties. The systematic uncertainty, due to using the efficiencies as fixed values in the \CP fit, is calculated using Method 1, where the uncertainties in the efficiencies are used as the scale of the variation.

\subsubsection{PID efficiencies}

PID efficiencies are used as fixed inputs in the \CP fit as shown in \eqns\ref{effcorrectionglw2body} and \ref{effcorrectionglw4body} and the values used are shown in \tab\ref{pideff}. The systematic uncertainty is calculated using Method 1, where the uncertainties in the efficiencies are used as the scale of the variation.

\subsubsection{Veto efficiencies}

Veto efficiencies are required in the \CP fit to correct for the veto applied in the two- and four-body ADS modes, as shown in \eqns\ref{effcorrectionads2body} and \ref{effcorrectionads4body}, with the actual values used shown in \tab\ref{vetoeff} along with their uncertainties. The systematic uncertainty, due to using these values as fixed inputs in the \CP fit, is calculated using Method 1, where the uncertainties in the efficiencies are used as the scale of the variation.

\subsubsection{Asymmetry corrections}

Corrections must be made in the \CP fit for production asymmetry and detection asymmetry as detailed in \sect\ref{sec:cpfit:asymmetries}. For each source of asymmetry a correction is applied in the \CP fit and a systematic uncertainty is assigned separately to each based on the uncertainty of each correction using Method 1. 

For the production asymmetry, a \runone value is extracted using measurements performed with \decay{\Bp}{\Dzb\pip} decays~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2016-054} in data. The equivalent results for \runtwo data are not currently available, therefore the production asymmetry for \runtwo is taken to have the same central value as \runone with twice the uncertainty, which is considered sufficient to cover any unknown difference in the production asymmetry due to the increased centre-of-mass energy. For the detection asymmetry, the corrections are obtained using \runone data, but the same results are used for \runtwo data. The changes to the detector between the data-taking periods are not expected to significantly affect the detection asymmetry measurement.  For each asymmetry correction the uncertainties are used as the scale of the variation for calculating the systematic uncertainty.

\subsubsection{Signal shape}
\label{sec:systematics:signal}

The signal shape, described in \sect\ref{sec:massfit:signal}, is modelled as a Double Crystal Ball with all the parameters fixed from simulation apart from the mean and a width. There are two sources of uncertainty in the choice of signal shape: the tail parameters, $\alpha$ and $n$, and the width ratio and yield fraction between the two CBs, $f_{\sigma}$ and $f_{cb}$ respectively. These two sources of uncertainty are treated separately and combined. The uncertainty in the tail parameters is quantified using Method 2, by using an alternative signal shape, formed from the sum of two Gaussian-like distributions with a common mean, different widths and two other parameters relating to the skewness and sharpness of the distribution~\cite{doublejohnson}. This shape is taken to have the same width ratio and yield fraction as the Double Crystal Ball used in the \CP fit. Other parameters are fixed from a maximum likelihood fit to the simulated signal sample, shown in \fig\ref{signalshapesys}. Data is generated with this alternative shape, and then the \CP fit is then performed to this generated data using the nominal fit model. The results from this method are given in the first row of \tab\ref{signalshapeSystematics}.

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Maximum likelihood fit performed on a simulated signal sample of DD candidates using an alternative shape~\cite{doublejohnson}.}
\label{signalshapesys}
\end{figure}

For the width ratio and yield fraction, a systematic uncertainty is assigned using Method 1, where the scale of the variation in the inputs used is the uncertainty in these values from the fits to simulated samples, as given in \tab\ref{signalparameters}. The results from this method are given in the second row of \tab\ref{signalshapeSystematics}. The systematic uncertainty from generating an alternative distribution and that from varying the Double Crystal Ball parameters are added in quadrature to give the total signal shape systematic uncertainty. The systematic uncertainty calculated from the use of the alternative shape dominates the systematic uncertainty relating to the signal shape for most of the \CP observables.

\caption{Summary of systematic uncertainties associated with the signal shape.}
\label{signalshapeSystematics}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Combinatorial background}

The shape parameter of the combinatorial, $\beta$, is fixed across all \Dz modes in the \CP fit, as there is not enough data for the fit to be stable if the slopes are allowed to vary in each mode. In order to get an idea of the variation in combinatorial shape between different \Dz modes, individual maximum likelihood fits are performed to each \Dz decay mode in the high \Bm mass region (5400 - 5600~\mevcc) using an exponential function. The data used for these fits is \runone data with the selection applied, except for \Kstar selection and \Dz and \KS FD significance cuts. PID selection on the \Dz daughters is applied in order to be sure of accessing the difference between the different \Dz modes. The selection requirements are loosened as described in order to be left with enough data to perform a meaningful fit. The systematic uncertainty is assigned using Method 2, with the combinatorial slope parameter, $\beta$, for each \Dz mode fixed to those given in \fig\ref{combinatoricDD}. The fits to the DD candidates are shown in \fig\ref{combinatoricDD}. Separate fits were also performed for LL candidates.

The fitted values for the exponential slope parameter, $\beta$, are given on each plot.}
\label{combinatoricDD}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Partially reconstructed background}
\label{sec:systematics:partreco}

The partially reconstructed decays have a completely fixed shape and yield in the \CP fit, as discussed in \sect\ref{sec:cpfit:partrecoyields}. Method 2 is used to assign a systematic uncertainty, by making three different modifications simultaneously to the partially reconstructed region. These modifications are:

\begin{itemize}
\item The yield is increased by 20\%. The uncertainty in the yield from the fit to \kpi invariant mass is about 5\%, but this is considered to be an underestimate as other partially reconstructed low mass backgrounds, such as \decay{\Bm}{\D\Kstarm\piz}, may contribute a very small amount at low reconstructed \Bm mass, outside of the \CP fit range. This could have a slight effect on the estimate for the yield of partially reconstructed background in the \CP fit, therefore a conservative systematic uncertainty of 20\% is used,
\item All partially reconstructed shapes are smeared by the difference in signal width between simulated samples and data. The width for all partially reconstructed shapes is increased by 4\% of LL bins and 5\% for DD bins,
\item A 10\% asymmetry is introduced for \CP violation in the partially reconstructed yields.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Charmless}

\Sect\ref{sec:backgrounds:charmless} shows that there is a possibility for residual charmless contribution to be present in \pipi mode. In order to estimate the associated systematic uncertainty Method 2 is used, where the yield of charmless events to be generated in the \pipi mode is drawn from a Gaussian distribution that has mean and width corresponding to the expected number of charmless events calculated in \sect\ref{sec:backgrounds:charmless}. The number of events is O(1) in each of the bins for the \pipi mode. For each pseudoexperiment, the value taken from the Gaussian distribution is rounded to a whole number and randomly distributed between \Bp and \Bm, as an additional contribution to the yield in the signal region. 

\subsubsection{\boldmath \decay{\Lb}{\Lc(p\kaon\pi)\Kstarm} background}

The model for the \kk mass spectrum in \CP fit contains an additional background from \decay{\Lb}{\Lc(p\kaon\pi)\Kstarm}, as described in \sect\ref{sec:backgrounds:Lb2LcKst}. The shape parameters are fixed from a maximum likelihood fit to a simulated sample of \decay{\Lb}{\Lc(p\kaon\pi)\Km}, the values of which are given in \tab\ref{fitresultsLb}. The systematic uncertainty corresponding to this model component is estimated using Method 2, varying the parameters of the model according to the uncertainties in \tab\ref{fitresultsLb}.

\subsubsection{\boldmath \decay{\Bs}{\Dzb\bar{K}^{*}(1410)^0} background}

The decay \decay{\Bs}{\Dzb\bar{K}^{*}(1410)^0} is considered as a background for the \pik mode, as described in \sect\ref{sec:backgrounds:bs}. The shape is taken from a maximum likelihood fit to simulated events and the yield is estimated to be $2.6 \pm 2.6$ events. The systematic uncertainty corresponding to this model component is estimated using Method 2, where the generated yield is drawn from a Gaussian distribution that has mean of $2.6$ and a width of $2.6$.

\subsection{Summary of systematic uncertainties}

\Tab\ref{systematics} summarises the systematic uncertainties for each of the different sources discussed in this section. If the systematic uncertainty was found to be over two orders of magnitude smaller than the statistical uncertainty then a value of zero is given. All systematic uncertainties are smaller than the corresponding statistical uncertainty. The systematic uncertainty due to the signal shape has a forms a significant contribution to the uncertainty for all the \CP observables. Leading systematic uncertainties in the yield ratios come from simulation efficiencies and branching ratios. These leading uncertainties are due to the propagation of uncertainties from other measurements, which could be reduced by further work into these measurements.

The final results for the \CP observables are

R^-_{K\pi\pi\pi} &= &&0.006&\ &\pm&\ &0.006&\ &\pm&\ &0.004&
\end{alignat*}
where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. The correlation matrices for the statistical and systematic uncertainties are given in Tabs.~\ref{statisticalcorrelations} and \ref{systematiccorrelations}, respectively. The large correlations of the systematic uncertainties are mainly due to contributions from production and detection asymmetries. Combined results from the \Kp\Km and \pip\pim decay modes, taking correlations into account, are
\begin{alignat*}{13}
R_{\CP+} &= &\ &1.18&\ &\pm&\ &0.08&\ &\pm&\ &0.02& \\
A_{\CP+} &= &\ &0.08&\ &\pm&\ &0.06&\ &\pm&\ &0.01&
\end{alignat*}
where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. The asymmetry in the GLW modes is not statistically significant. The \CP observables $R^+$ and $R^-$, for the \pik and \pikpipi decay modes, can be transformed into $R_{ADS} = \left(R^- + R^+\right)/2\ $and \mbox{$A_{ADS} = \left(R^- - R^+\right)/\left(R^- + R^+\right)$} in order to compare with the results from \babar~\cite{BaBarDKstar}. These results, taking correlations into account, are
\begin{alignat*}{13}
R_{ADS}^{K\pi} &= &\ &0.011&\ &\pm&\ &0.004&\ &\pm&\ &0.001& \\
A_{ADS}^{K\pi} &= &\ -&0.81&\ &\pm&\ &0.17&\ &\pm&\ &0.04& \\
R_{ADS}^{K\pi\pi\pi} &= &\ &0.011&\ &\pm&\ &0.005&\ &\pm&\ &0.003& \\
A_{ADS}^{K\pi\pi\pi} &= &\ -&0.45&\ &\pm&\ &0.21&\ &\pm&\ &0.14&
\end{alignat*}
where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. The measured asymmetries and ratios for the two-body \Dz meson decay modes are consistent with, and more precise than, the previous measurements from \babar~\cite{BaBarDKstar}. 

The Wilks' theorem statistical significance~\cite{Wilks:1938dza} of the two-body and four-body ADS decay modes, is defined as,
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{-2ln\left(\frac{L_0}{L_i}\right)}
\end{equation}
where $L_0$ is the extended maximum likelihood value for the nominal \CP fit model and $L_i$ is the extended maximum likelihood value for the alternative model, which forces $R_{ADS}^{K\pi} = 0$ or $R_{ADS}^{K\pi\pi\pi} = 0$ respectively. Therefore, the more unlikely that the alternative model is correct, given the data, the higher the statistical significance. It is worth noting that this calculation does not account for systematic uncertainties. The signal significance for the four-body ADS decay mode is calculated to be 2.8$\sigma$, while for the two-body ADS decay mode it is calculated to be 4.2$\sigma$, showing the first evidence for \pik decays.

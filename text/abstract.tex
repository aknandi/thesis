Measurements of \CP violation in \btodkst decays, including the sensitivity to the CKM angle \Pgamma, is presented in this thesis. Decays of the \D meson to two- and four-body final states containing kaons and pions are investigated. Observables are measured that are sensitive to the CKM angle \Pgamma, and the hadronic parameters of the decay \rb and \deltab. These measurements are performed using proton-proton collsion data collected by the Large Hadron Collider beauty (\lhcb) experiment from 2011 to 2016. This data corresponds to 1\invfb and 2\invfb of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7\tev \text{ and } 8\tev$ collected in 2011 and 2012, and 1.8\invfb at $\sqrt{s} = 13\tev$ collected in 2015 and 2016. A value of $\Pgamma = 40.9^{\circ}$ is measured with a $1\sigma$ confidence interval of $[24.7, 60.2]^{\circ}$, and $2\sigma$ confidence intervals of $[10.2, 86.1]^{\circ}$ and $[100.0,165.2]^{\circ}$, which is consistent with the world average measurement of \Pgamma. A value of $\rb = 0.113^{+0.015}_{-0.021}$ for \btodkst decays is measured, which is the world's most precise value and is consistent with previous measurements.

Measurements of \CP violation in \btodkst decays, including the sensitivity to the CKM angle \Pgamma, are presented in this thesis. Decays of the \Dz meson to \Km\pip, \Km\Kp, \pim\pip, \pim\Kp, \Km\pip\pim\pip, \pim\pip\pim\pip, and \pim\Kp\pim\pip are investigated. Observables are measured that are sensitive to the CKM angle \Pgamma and the hadronic parameters of the decay \rb and \deltab. These measurements are performed using proton-proton collision data collected by the Large Hadron Collider beauty (\lhcb) experiment from 2011 to 2016. This data corresponds to the largest yields observed in these modes. The world's first \CP violation measurements in four-body \Dz decay modes using the \btodkst channel are presented. The first evidence of the \btodkst mode, where the \Dz decays to \pim\Kp, is also obtained with a signal significance of 4.2$\sigma$. A value of $\Pgamma = 40.9^{\circ}$ is measured with a $1\sigma$ confidence interval of $[25, 58]^{\circ}$, and $2\sigma$ confidence intervals of $[10, 87]^{\circ}$ and $[97,167]^{\circ}$, which is consistent with the world average measurement of \Pgamma. The world's most precise value of $\rb = 0.113^{+0.017}_{-0.019}$ for \btodkst decays is measured.
